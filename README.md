# LAN-Worm-Templates

(LAN=Local Area Network/the network between nearby/reachable computers)

Worms, Email worms, mIRC worms, Instant Messaging worms...
Those are dinosaurs, inferior, if people get a suspicious email
from a person they know in a creepy format they
don't really open it no more these days, but LAN and Network worms on the other hand
Those don't require confirmation, they arnt vampires, they don't require you
To open the door, they pick the lock.

But u are a dumbass and don't wanna put in the work for a LAN worm?
Well don't worry! Cuz I gotcha!
There are 3 templates in 3 languages, 
Assembly, BatchFile and Visual Basic.
they are in plain .txt format so you can just copy paste the code 
and put it into your worm.

3 simple steps:

Copy my script/code

Mash it into your worm script and hope it will work

Enjoy your highly destructive LAN worm:))
